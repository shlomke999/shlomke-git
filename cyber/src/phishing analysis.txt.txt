It is important to know that when reading an email header every line can be forged, so only the Received: lines that are created by your service should be completely trusted.

•	The from field displays who the message is from, however, this can be easily forged and can be the least reliable.

Return-Path
•	The email address for return mail. This is the same as "Reply-To:".

Received
•	The received is the most important part of the email header and is usually the most reliable. They form a list of all the servers/computers through which the message traveled in order to reach you.
The received lines are best read from bottom to top. That is, the first "Received:" line is your own system or mail server. The last "Received:" line is where the mail originated.

Received-SPF: 
This header represents the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) results,
which tells whether the sender is a permitted sender or not.

ARC Authentication Results: 
This header contains email authentication results like
SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

Finding the Original Sender
The easiest way for finding the original sender is by looking for the X-Originating-IP header. This header is important since it tells you the IP address of the computer that had sent the email. If you cannot find the X-Originating-IP header, then you will have to sift through the Received headers to find the sender's IP address.

 Analyze Links and Attachments
Link Verification: Hover over any links without clicking. Check if the URL matches the organization’s official site.

spf - a domain can define what servers ae allowed to send emails from it.
dkim (DomainKeys Identified Mail) - enables domain owners to automatically “sign”
emails from their domain.
DMARC - a policy for the reciving server(!) what to do with the email based on the result of the spf and dkim (quarantine, reject, deliver).

A. Initial Assessment
1.	Sender’s Email Address:
o	Check the sender's email address closely. Look for slight misspellings or unusual domain names (e.g., @gmaill.com instead of @gmail.com).
2.	Subject Line and Content:
o	Evaluate the subject line and the body of the email. Is it generic (e.g., "You have won a prize")? Does it contain urgent calls to action?
B. Analyzing Email Headers
1.	Check the 'From' Field:
o	Identify the "From" address and verify if it matches the domain of the organization purportedly sending the email.
2.	Look at the 'Return-Path' and 'Reply-To' Fields:
o	See if the return-path aligns with the sender's domain. Phishing emails often have mismatched return-paths.
3.	Examine the Received Lines:
o	Review the “Received” lines to trace the email’s path. Look for suspicious or unfamiliar IP addresses.
4.	Check for DKIM, SPF, and DMARC:
o	Look for DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signatures and SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records to verify if the email is sent from an authorized server.
o	DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) can provide insights on how the domain owner wants unauthenticated emails to be handled.
C. Content Analysis
1.	Grammar and Spelling:
o	Phishing emails often contain poor grammar and spelling mistakes. Legitimate organizations usually have well-proofread content.
2.	Links and Attachments:
o	Hover over any links to see the actual URL. Avoid clicking on them until verified.
o	Be wary of unexpected attachments, especially executable files.
3.	Urgency and Threats:
o	Assess the tone of the email. Phishing attempts often create a sense of urgency or threat (e.g., “Your account will be suspended!”).
